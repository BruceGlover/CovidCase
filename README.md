1. From the plot the number of cases one after the other have similar rise except at the points of first
and second wave.
2. It is clearly evident from the graph that the number cases in coming days depend on the present
number of cases.
3. The first wave starts around August 2020 and lasts till October 2020 while the second wave is at its
peak around May 2021

1. From the value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, we can see that the degree of correlation
between the two time sequences is very strong.
2. We generally expect observations (here number of COVID-19 cases) on days one after the other to be
similar. It holds to a very good extent here as we can see that the correlation coefficient is almost 1.
3. Because our assumption that the observations at previous time steps are useful to predict the value
at the next time step is true in this case.

1. From the nature of the spread of data points, the nature of correlation between the two sequences is
very high but not perfect zero.
2. Yes the scatter plot seem to obey the nature reflected by Pearson’s correlation coefficient calculated
in 1.b in the start and towards the end of the graph

1. The correlation coefficient value decreases gradually with respect to increase in lags in time sequence.
2. Because as we keep increasing the lag the number of possible matches decreases because the series “hang
out” at the ends and do not overlap
